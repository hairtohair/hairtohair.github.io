<p>It’s important to remember that you use your thumb — not your whole hand — to steadily open and close the blades. Ricky advises, “going around just the hairline with clippers or scissors and leaving the rest will make the messy locks look a little more purposeful. Also known as slide cutting, the slithering technique requires that the follicles be held away from the scalp so that a right angle is formed. Just check your corners, that they don�t go round.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that you use your thumb — not your whole hand — to steadily open and close the blades. This keeps the scissors from going rogue and cutting uneven lines. This trims bushy looking edges and is more important the longer the hair is. Mix scissor cuts with a trimmer cut. You can get them in lots of different lengths, but many experts like shears that are no longer than 5.5 inches. Regular scissors are not sharp enough to cut hair easily or effectively and any haircut done with them is guaranteed to look horrible (take it from someone who cut her own fringe with regular scissors for a couple of months before realising).</p>
