<p>But armin tells mikasa that eren must have been protecting his two best friends safe by throwing them away with insults and lies about ackerman biology. That’s why she had such bad headaches immediately before killing him in chapter 138 of the manga. Did mikasa tell eren about jean�s compliment? Chapter 100 hinted this but chapter 130 confirms this.</p>

<p>Is the Mikasa in the first scene a child? In the next page, They both possess the same dream of seeing the world. Because from my perspective jean doesn�t have long hair ( we all know that ) nor did he ever like or complement another girls hair other than mikasas.
